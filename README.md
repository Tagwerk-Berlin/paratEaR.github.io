## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Tagwerk-Berlin/paratEaR.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Null Reference Exception is one of the worst bugs that you can have in your code. It is just painful. In order to protect from this type of exception, you need a bulletproof design of the application and a lot of checks for parameters of the functions. This new feature should help us with that and make our code more readable and robust.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Tagwerk-Berlin/paratEaR.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
